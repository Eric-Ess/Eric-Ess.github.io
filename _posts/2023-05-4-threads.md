## Tuesday's Summary
On tuesday we did RNA extractions of 5 samples of the oysters. Grace showed Henry and I the ropes. Was around 3-4 hours. It is a slow process, and we didn't do the final step.

## Today's Summary
Tested some number threads. 1.5 hours. Henry came and took over for me. Going to do some work on this site to make it prettier.

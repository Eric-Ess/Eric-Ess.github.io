# Immune priming injection vs. emersion pilot

### Update 4/4/2023
1. 15 diploid and 15 triploid oysters were placed in 50 gL-1 MgCL overnight (18 hours). Here are how many opened:

| ploidy  | time  | open  | closed  | percent  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2n  | 18h  | 12  | 3  | 80%  |
| 3n  | 18h  | 11  | 4  | 73%  |

2. poly(I:C) solution was prepared by adding 4 ml of sterile, 0.2 um filtered seawater to a vial w/ 10 mg of lyopholized powder. Solution was incubated at 65C for 10 minutes and allowed to cool to room temp.
3. 10 diploid and 10 triploid oysters were injected w/ 100 ul of poly(I:C) solution (total of 0.25 mg per animal) in the adductor muscle. Oysters were allowed to sit open for 10 minutes and returned to seawater for recovery.
```
Oysters injected:
Diploid: D1-3, D5-8, D10-11, D13
Triploid: T3-7, T9-13
```
4. 5 diploid and 5 triploid oysters (from MgCl treatment) were returned to seawater to recover; tissue will be sampled as anathesia control.
5. 10 diploid and 10 triploid oysters (naive) were added to an emersion bath containing 500 ml of seawater contianing 10 ug/ml Poly(I:C), with a bubbler. Lafont et al 2017 found that emersion at [38 ug/ml worked for 24 hrs](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-017-13564-0/MediaObjects/41598_2017_13564_MOESM1_ESM.doc), so we will see.

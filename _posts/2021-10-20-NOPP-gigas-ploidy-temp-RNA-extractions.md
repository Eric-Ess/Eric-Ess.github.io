Species: *Crassostrea gigas* <br />
variable: ploidy, elevated seawater temperature, desiccation <br />

### Background:
RNA extractions from ctenidia were performed using the lab [RNazol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/rna_isolation_rnazol_rt.md) protocol. Tissue used was from 72 diploid and triploid oysters:

1. sdate: July 12, 2021 - 12 diploid and 12 triploid - controls
2. sdate: July 12, 2021 - 12 diploid and 12 triploid - 30C
3. sdate: July 13, 2021 - 12 diploid and 12 triploid - 30C + desiccation

The sample list, with RNA results, can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KY6P25HEmrDeszph56OY7tI1vAOd2rXxQ8wfZtCM7g0/edit?usp=sharing).

The concentration of extracted RNA was first estimated using the nanodrop. These values were then used to dilute RNA for analysis on the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer using [RNA 6000 Pico](https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/Public/G2938-90046_RNA600Pico_KG_EN.pdf) chips, which have a detection range of 50-5000 pg/ul for Total RNA in water.

Here are the results of the first 11 samples that I ran today:

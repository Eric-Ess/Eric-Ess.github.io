## More Thinking
Started writing a very short [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MEeW22jcp67DmgbpTFFHPA_pPB0TnZVySKBuJimk7Ik/edit?usp=sharing)
<br><br>
Working treatment groups: warming, acidification, hypoxia (desiccation), warming + acidification, control
<br><br>
Been exploring genes to examine. HIFa (Hypoxia Inducible Factor a), HSP70 (Heat shock protein), DICER,
<br><br>
I am still wondering about immunity. That is what I am most interested in/most familiar with but I am unsure on how to  facilitate it as an environmental condition other than polyIC. Maybe I don't and see if immune related genes get downregulated in the absence of pathogens but presence of other environmental stress? Immunity-related genes to explore: Toll-like receptor 4, Viperin, any of the interleukins, cGAS.

Today I attended the USDA/ARS meeting in Portland, OR. Neil outlined the USDA's plan to take over and expand the OSU Molluscan Broodstock Program (MBP). The new program will be housed at the OSU Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, OR within the expanded USDA-ARS Pacific Shellfish Breeding Center. Here is a [OSU newsletter](https://marineresearch.oregonstate.edu/comes/news/comes-newsletter-spring-2021) discussing the change.

## Project Thinking
Advice from Ariana: <br><br>
Should start doing random extractions instead of just going down the spreadhseet to avoid possible complications (e.g what if bad reagent and now a whole group is unknowable). Might also take notes of the reagents used and their dates. <br><br>
Would love to do a new acute Stress, this would look for stress memory. Do I go +13 degrees like last time? Would like to do this in Febuary.
<br>
## Nanodrop
Ran nanodrop with broad range dye. RNA amounts logged into [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lsWsYwgtUs4AimD27TMMAhoxYRcAO3J942y43QE_JWs/edit?usp=sharing). May need to run a few again with narrow range.
## Hatchery yesterday
Ariana and Steven went to the hatchery and cleaned tubes, took size measurements. Images in new [github repo](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/tree/main/lifestage_carryover) <br>
#### housekeeping / to do
Need to organize things into new [github repo](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/tree/main/lifestage_carryover). Need to record data on google sheet from Ariana's notes from the hatchery. More RNA extractions next week.

## Today's Summary
Tested 16 threads. A lot of them broke. One sample (G26) had all three threads brake during the force test. The adhesive part stayed on the sheet. There were no other threads to test on this sample. Also two times a little bit of the mica came off with it. Not a lot of good tests came out of today. Hoping next time is better.

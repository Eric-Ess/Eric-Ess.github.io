## Today's Summary
Tested around 10 threads. Calling it an hour early because I am debilitatingly tired and I don't want it to affect the work. A lot of threads breaking today, at first I assumed it was my fault but that doesn't seem to be the case. I think the adhesive on some of them was just so strong the thread broke first. I also decided to start clasping them to the third setting (maximum) because I had one slip out. I think the nature of the tool is to get less grippy over time because it unbends itself. <br> <br>
Also, a naming system is needed for when I do multiple tests of a single thread due to breakages. <br> <br>
Also, at the beginning of the session today a few plates fell out of the samples and I cannot figure out where they go. This could be a problem.

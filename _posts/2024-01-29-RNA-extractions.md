## First RNA extractions

[Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1goE9G98pyKh1g7xfuQ9TdRsmz2e4gMQ8xcoAYQryajI/edit?usp=sharing)
<br><br>
Isolated RNA from the following samples:
411-1, 411-1M, 411-2, 411-2M, 411-3, 411-3M, 411-4, 411-4M <br><br>
Info (e.g sample weight) regarding each can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lsWsYwgtUs4AimD27TMMAhoxYRcAO3J942y43QE_JWs/edit?usp=sharing).<br><br>
Ran nanodrop on 411-1 to assess quality. Quality was fairly poor, many salts, though at least there is certainly RNA. 260/280 was 1.64, 260/230 was 2.08.

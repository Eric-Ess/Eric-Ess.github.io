# Project Updates

## Oct 4
On 10/4 adults and juviniles where mechanically stressed again. Flouremeter:  direct feeding is 20. Tote reading is ~3. Silos reading ~20 at 11:20. 125mL food into 1000mL reads 50. 125mL into 1000mL again reads 53. Ratio of 8 water:food, 8 * 50 = 400.
## Oct 6
Temp was higher for both, around 19ºC for control.
## Oct 11
Temp was back down to 17ºC. Treatment adults and juveniles were spun again for 15 min. fouremeter: ~9 in treatment tank, ~4 in control. 125mL into 1000mL yields 89... so 640. pH is around 8. Re-measured some juveniles (P5) to see if groth occured.

## 2nd Acute Stress
Similar to the acute stress done on adults in november, [ notebook post here](https://eric-ess.github.io/SecondStress/), half of the Oysters from the different life stage groups were subjected to 32 degrees C for 30 minutes. We only did this for one adult group (bird) to allow the others to grow once the ambient temp warms.

Oysters were sampled immediately after stress. We also sampled oysters not subjected to this acute stress (ambient).

We sampled gill tissue for RNA (in RNA later), DNA (in 70% etOH), and proteomic/metabolomic (flash frozen) analysis. The tissue in RNA later was stored overnight at room temp, then overnight at 4ยบC before going into -80. The DNA was stored in 4ยบ. The flash frozen samples were stored in -80.

Here is the [metadata](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/blob/main/lifestage_carryover/data/sampling_metadata/20240228_sampling_metadata.csv) for each sample, including tube numbers.

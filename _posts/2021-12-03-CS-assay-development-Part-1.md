### Information about plate reader

Here is the [manual](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/equipment_manuals/Perkin-Elmer_plate-reader_Wallac-Victor-1420-User-Manual.pdf) and a list of the filters we have:

Excitation: F355 nm, F485 nm, P405 nm, P450 nm, P490 nm, P555 nm
Emission: F460 nm, F535 nm, F590 nm, D545 nm, D572 nm, D615 nm, D642 nm, D665 nm

The F-filters are for fluorometry, the D-filters are for time-resolved fluorometry, and the P are for photometry.

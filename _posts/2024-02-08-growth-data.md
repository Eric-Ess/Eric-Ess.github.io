[lengths spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FzmBKACmgf4Mt0i75l_yDv3RfTQeKKnRuQ78ClAINCE/edit?usp=sharing). Averages are colored orange. <br>

#### Today's Summary
Finished inputting all length data. Was able to do a quick look at growth. <br><br>The most growth is seen in the second youngest life stage (seed) in the treatment tank. They grew an average of 13 mm. The least growth was in the adults, they did not grow much at all. In fact, they seemed to get shorter which could be attributed to small shell breakages.

#### Next steps
Need to do qPCR for the RNA I extracted. Planning to get out to the hatchery feb 28th for another stress + sample.

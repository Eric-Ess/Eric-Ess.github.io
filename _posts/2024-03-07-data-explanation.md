Here is a complete summary of the experiment

## Oysters
235 adults, 40-100mm
- 4 families
  - 30 diploid
  - 30 triploid
<br> a few missing, hence n≠240. These groups of 30 were given a color or animal name.

120 juveniles: USDA 2023 spawn, 20-55mm

120 seed: USDA 2023 spawn, 6-15mm

*roughly* 120 spat: USDA 2023 spawn, 1-6mm
## Experiment
Half from each group were put into a treatment tank, half into a control tank.

| control:                            | treatment:                          |

| 15 fam1 triploid                    | 15 fam1 triploid                    |
| 15 dam2 diploid                     | 15 dam2 diploid                     |

| 15 fam3 diploid                     | 15 fam3 diploid                     |
| 15 fam3 triploid                    | 15 fam3 triploid                    |
| 15 dam4 diploid                     | 15 dam4 diploid                     |
| 15 fam4 triploid                    | 15 fam4 triploid                    |
| 60 juveniles (usda, mixed families) | 60 juveniles (usda, mixed families) |
| 60 seed (usda, mixed families)      | 60 seed (usda, mixed families)      |
| ~60 spat (usda, mixed families)     | ~60 spat (usda, mixed families)     |

Adults kept in bags at the bottom of the tanks. Seed and spat were kept in tubes, and juveniles were kept in tubes within tubes, they won't be in water that has been exposed to other groups.

treatment left, control right.

The control tank was left at ambient temp, around 17ºC. The treatment tank was heated (+2ºC per hour) up to 26ºC, for 6 hours a day, for 7 weeks (began 10 2 2023, ended 11 21 2023). Tubes were cleaned semi-regularly

Adults and juveniles mechanically stressed via salad spinner for 15 minutes on these dates: 10/2/2023, 10/4/2023, 10/11/2023

[Lengths](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-carryover/tree/main/lifestage_carryover/data/size) recorded periodically.
###### On 11/21/2023:

4 groups (dog, yellow, cat, toad) (n=120) were sampled for later RNA and DNA analysis.

We took 7 from a group of 15 (e.g 7 from "fam1 diploid" in "control") and immediately sampled those. We cut gill tissue and mantle tissue, placed in separate tubes each with RNA later. We also put tissue into a tube with 70% etOH for DNA analysis. Efforts were taken to minimize cross-contamination (clean gloves and tools).

The other 8 from this group of 15 were placed into a bucket of seawater at 32ºC for 30 minutes, then tumbled for 5 minutes in a salad spinner. They were immediately sampled in the same fashion.

We repeated this for the equivalent in each tank (e.g if we did this for we also did this for fam1 diploid in control, we also did this for fam1 diploid in treatment).

Heaters were turned off and treatment tank was left at ambient.

###### On 2/28/2024:

We repeated this process from 11/21/2023 but with some differences. Namely:
- Sampled *all* seed, *all* spat, and *all* juveniles
- Did *not* sample remaining Adults
- Only gill tissue was taken
- No mechanical stress
- all tubes for seed and spat are individuals, no multiple samples from the same oysters
- flash froze samples for potential proteomic/metabolomic analysis

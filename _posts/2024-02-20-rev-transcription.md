## Reverse Transcription
Began Transcription of the RNA samples. Here is the [protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Q93dtkho11yo6WQEoMAlNXXcNYNPNomOnghHONPYJM/edit?usp=sharing). Sam walked me through it last week. Completed:

| 411-1  | 411-1M  |  411-2 | 411-3  |
|---|---|---|---|

<br> I have pretty low confidence in the quality of these because this was my first time doing this. I very well could have made some pipetting errors. Haven't done any sort of quality check.

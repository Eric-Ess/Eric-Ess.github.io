## Sampling and Second Stress

Took 7 adults from 4 groups (dog, yellow, cat, toad) and sampled them for later RNA and DNA extractions. Stressed the other 8 at 30 degrees C for 30 minutes followed by 5 minutes of mechanical. Sampled those as well immediately following the stress. The other three life stages remained in their respective tubes, though we cleaned them out and I will take measurements via ImageJ to see growth. <br><br>
New measurements and respective sample number logged into [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lsWsYwgtUs4AimD27TMMAhoxYRcAO3J942y43QE_JWs/edit?usp=sharing)<br><br>
Took pictures of oysters + tags to reference later (dog is missing):

We also took pictures of the juvenile which I will look at in imageJ to get measurements next week.

## Experimental Setup

![](/users/ericessington/documents/GitHub/Eric-Ess.github.io/post_images/100223/Setup.png)
Treatment on left, control on right

Treatment: heated semi-gradually (+ ~2ºC per hour) up to 25ºC for 6 hr once per day. This will continue for the next couple weeks. Adults, juveniles were removed and mechanically stressed via a salad spinner for 15 minutes. This will be repeated probably once a week. <br><br>
Control: held at roughly 17º <br><br>
Both are fed 10L of pavlova per day. <br><br>
flourescence: ~25 in tubes for treatment, ~30 in tubes for control. ~12 in main pool with adults. This measurement was taken once at the end of the day.<br><br>
Size measurements (length) of larger oysters were recorded, going to measure the very small ones via imageJ or similar software later this week. Lengths will be logged into [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FzmBKACmgf4Mt0i75l_yDv3RfTQeKKnRuQ78ClAINCE/edit#gid=0).

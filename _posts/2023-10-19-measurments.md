All lengths have been logged into [the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FzmBKACmgf4Mt0i75l_yDv3RfTQeKKnRuQ78ClAINCE/edit#gid=0). However, it was not possible to obtain all the length measurments for the youngest group due to overlap, so I manually measured 20 or so from each in order to get an estimate.

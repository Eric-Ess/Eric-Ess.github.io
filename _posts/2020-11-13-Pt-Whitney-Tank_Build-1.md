## Background

We are planning on conducting a mesocosm experiment at the [Jamestown Pt. Whitney Shellfish Hatchery and Research Laboratory](https://goo.gl/maps/27SMdcsPRsNcg6Le9) that compares the genomic response of pacific oysters to temperature stress. 

The planned parameters of the experiment are as follows:

1. triploid/diploid pacific oysters (juvenile ~0.5 in) from 10 distinct families
2. temperature stress up to 40 C
3. high temp exposure lasting for 1w if possible
4. rapid ramp up to temp (little/no acclimation)
5. full access to food (no energetic limitation)
6. no ocean acidiciation or hypoxia exposure

The goal of the experiment is to identify which biological pathways in triploid and diploid oysters respond differently under <severe> temperature stress. The matched genetic background of the triploid and diploid oysters and within family replication will aid in the discovery of genetic variability that imparts performance benefits in the face of climate change and could be the basis for broodstock selection by commercial aquaculture opperations in the future. 

## Current Progress

Pt. Whitney has the space and resources for 4 large seawater tanks. [https://genefish.slack.com/files/U01D50SDEBT/F01DR9YGPMH/tank_design_3_in_diameter_silo.png](https://genefish.slack.com/files/U01D50SDEBT/F01DR9YGPMH/tank_design_3_in_diameter_silo.png)

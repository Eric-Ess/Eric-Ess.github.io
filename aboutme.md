### Current Research 

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate in [Steven Robert's lab](http://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/) in the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington in Seattle. I study how the environment impacts marine animals at the physiological and molecular systems level. I am particularly interested in how human-influenced environmental change is affecting species important to U.S. fisheries. I conduct experiments that simulate various ocean conditions and use omics approaches (e.g. epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) to measure animal response. To process these diverse datasets, I develop and implement bioinformatics pipelines for data normalization, statistical analyses, and biological pathway analyses. I use an [open access online lab notebook](https://mattgeorgephd.github.io//notebook/) and [GitHub](https://mattgeorgephd.github.io/) to publicly share my analyses and support reproducibility.

My research addresses the overarching aim of identifying responses in molecular systems that could be predictive of species tolerance for environmental change. I aim for my research to contribute to informing policy in both aquaculture industries and conservation, and to contribute to education around how climate change may impact certain animals. Towards this, I collaborate with commercial, tribal, and governmental fisheries organizations, and actively participate in outreach media development.
